# Pre-Fab

::: warning Pre-Fab
Things to do _before_ FabAcademy
:::

The course will in January 2025, it will be a very intensive and busy journey - you will probably run out of time to finish the weekly assignments in the depth you want. 

<Figure :src="image1.src" alt="Image Alt" caption="Image Caption" />

We therefore highly suggest that you take the time from now until the beginning of FabAcademy to learn about the following:

- [Git ↘︎](#git)
- [SSGs, Static Site Generators ↘︎](##static-site-generators)
- Parametric Modelling in 3D (Fusion 360, FreeCAD)
- Programming MCUs (Arduino, ESP32, XIAO, etc)
- EDA (Eagle, KiCad)

### Git

How to use _git_ from the terminal
While you will have access to a 3D Printer, we highly suggest to get your own, especially if you plan to make longer prints and larger objects.

### Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators - or SSGs - are a fancy way of describing a _website_. You will have to document your assignments on your personal webspace - which is a git repository in the [Academany FabCloud](https://academany.fabcloud.io/).

You are welcome to write HTML and style it with CSS, but you will find out that this takes a lot of time - and it makes _documenting-on-the-go_ not so easy.

The Academany FabCloud is a private version of [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) which offers [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).

> With GitLab Pages, you can publish static websites directly from a repository in GitLab.

In Week 1 your assignment is to make a documentation page - on GitLab Pages - and documenet how you did it. You are free to choose any SSGs.

Popular and trusted SSGs are:
- [Material for mkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)

There are many, many more. It's for you to find out try which one you like best.

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)/[ClassPress](https://www.classicpress.net/) is NOT a _Static Site Generator_, because it needs a _dynamic_ database & PHP to run. If you really, really want - and know a bit about Wordpress - you can [collect the output of Wordpress as HTML](https://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/kamakura/students/georg-tremmel/site/) and use that for your documentation.

### Parametric Modelling in 3D

Getting used to working with 3D modelling software is probably one of the hardest skills to learn during FabAcademy.

You are free which software to use, popular choices are Fusion 360 and FreeCAD. As we aim to use Open Source Software for FabAcademy, we will focus on FreeCAD

## Assignments & Documentation

You are required to do your weekly assignment and to document your homework - ideally in the style of a tutorial. Local and Global Evaluators will judge you on the basis of your documentation and you will only get a pass for each week's homework when the evaluators are happy with it. (See also: [Assessment Guidelines](https://fabacademy.org/2024))

You can already have a look at the [FabAcademy 2024 Schedule](https://fabacademy.org/2024/schedule.html) and - if possible - already pre-make some of homework assignments. The homework assignments are at the bottom of each page, for example for [Week 1/Project Management](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/index.html).

> **assignment**
> 1. read, sign the student/instructor/lab agreements, and commit to your repos
> 2. work through a git tutorial
> 3. build a personal site in the class archive describing you and your final project

While this does not sound too difficult and time-consuming, this homework is assessed against the following questions:

> Have you answered these questions?
> - Sketched your final project idea(s)
> - Described briefly what it will do and who will use it
> - Made a website and described how you did it
> - Created a section about yourself on that website
> - Added a page with your sketch and description of your final project idea(s)
> - Documented steps for setting up your Git repository and adding files to it
> - Pushed to your class GitLab repository
> - Signed and uploaded Student Agreement

Only if theses questions are successfully answered by your documentation - and checked by Local and Global Evaluators - you will get a "complete" mark for this specific week.
