# About <em>Virtual</em> FabLab Sapporo

Sapporo is a city with nearly 2 million people, Hokkaido as a whole has more than 5 million, and currently (Sept 2024) there is only one FabLab in Hokkaido - the [FabLab in Kuriyama](https://fablabkuriyama.jp/).

There are other, [co-working](http://kaeru.space) and [maker spaces](http://sharegarage.jp) in Sapporo, but not of them has a full [Fab Inventory](http://inventory.fabcloud.io).

FabLab Sapporo is currently a website only, with the goal to organise and facilitate courses like the [FabAcademy](https://fabacademy.org), and [How to Grow Almost Anything](https://htgaa.org), and also continue the collaboration with [BioClub Tokyo](https://bioclub.tokyo) on workshops, events & experiments.

The mid/long-term goal is to establish a space & community similar to BioClub in Sapporo - focusing on Open Sciene, DIY Bio, Community Biology, SynBio, Kids Workshops, BioArt & BioDesign. It will probably have some of the machines and devices of a _real_ FabLab - but most likely not all of them. For that we have FabLab Kuriyama.
