| 2 | Computer-Aided Design |
| 3 | Computer-Controlled Cutting |
| 4 | Electronics Production |
| 5 | 3D Scanning and Printing |
| 6 | Embedded Programming |
| 7 | Computer-Controlled Machining |
| 8 | Electronics Design |
| 9 | Output Devices |
| 10 & 11 | Mechanical Design, Machine Design |
| 12 | Input Devices |

# FabAcademy in Hokkaido

FabAcademy and FabLabs are still quite new to Hokkaido, there is FabLab Kuriyama, whose staff participated in FabAcademy in 2020 and 2022, in collaboration with FabLab Kamakura, but FabAcademy did not run for the General Public yet in Hokkaido!

Let's be ambitions, and make FabAcademy 2025 in Hokkaido happen!

<em>Auditing</em> means trying out a class, but without grades or certificates. If you audit the course and decide to take it as a full student in the future, you will have to pay the full tuition fees.

More information about the [FabAcademy Cost Structure](https://fabacademy.org/apply/fees.html#title-tuition-fees-fab-academydescription-discover-the-details-of-fab-academy-tuition-fees-an-investment-in-your-educational-journey-learn-about-the-cost-structure-and-payment-options)

<em>Auditing & Lab Access</em> is more expensive than <em>Local Costs</em> because of the increased workload on the Local Instructors.

# Organising FabLab

The organising FabLab for FabAcademy 2025 in Hokkaido is [FabLab Hamamatsu](http://www.take-space.com/?lang=en) - with our Mentor & Guru Masato Takemura.

While FabLab Kuriyama is a [fully-equipped FabLab](http://inventory.fabcloud.io), there is currently no qualified Local Instructor at FabLab Kuriyama - that why we are excited to have Take-san as Mentor & Guru!

Therefore, if you fill out the [FabAcademy 2025 Registration Form](https://form.jotform.com/FabAcademy/2025-student-registration-form), please select _FabLab Hamamatsu_.

# Pre-Fab

The course starts in January 2025, it will be an intensive journey - you will probably run out of time to finish the weekly assignments in the depth you want. We highly suggest that you take the time from now until the beginning of FabAcademy to learn about:

- Git
- SSGs, Static Site Generators
- Parametric Modelling in 3D (Fusion 360, FreeCAD)
- Programming MCUs (Arduino, ESP32, XIAO, etc)
- EDA (Eagle, KiCad)

While you will have access to a 3D Printer, we highly suggest to get your own, especially if you plan to make longer prints and larger objects.

# Interviews

We are happy to talk to you in-person or via Zoom about the benefits and challenges of FabAcademy. The reason why only ~50% of the students each year manage to finish the course and graduate is not because the course is so difficult, but because students underestimate the time the need for the course each week!  
With the personal interview we want to make sure that you know exactly what you have to do for FabAcademy.

# Questions & Answers

**Do I have to be good in English to participate?**  
FabAcademy is a global course, it is taught in English. You are also required to write your documentation in English, and your presentations and presentation video should also be in English.  
As long as you can follow the English in the [lectures](https://vimeo.com/906141748), it should be fine.

**How many hours/week do I have to spend for FabAcademy?**
Depending on your expertise in parametric modelling, programming and circuit-design, somewhere between 25 hours and 40 hours.

**Why do students have to pay for FabAcademy?**
During the course, students will get 40 days free access to a FabLab, all the materials they need to make the assignments, and expert tutoring, both from Local and Global Instructors. And the pressure to finish the course is free. The tuition costs sounds a lot, but if you have the time and energy to commit to the course it is worth it. (Or if you want to go to MIT, like one of my students from Kamakura 2023 üòÅ).

**Can I audit the course?**
If you don't want to pay for the course, there is the possibility audit the course, I suggest to watch the lecture and recitations videos, and do the homework. I am happy to give feedback - and if necessary - a little guidance.
We can also arrange lab access - or you can arrange lab access for yourself.

**Do I have to do the assignments every week?**
Yes. 

**Do I have to join the lectures every week?**
Yes, because the Random Generator might call your name and you will be asked to present and share your weekly homework.

**Can I use 'AI' to write my documentaton?**
You can use 'AI' chatbots to write your documentation, but you absolutely have to cite it - like any other reference. The goal of FabAcademy should be to learn the various fabrication topics, it's up to you if you want to learn - or just too enough to pass.

**Any more questions?**  
Please get in touch via the Contact Form!
