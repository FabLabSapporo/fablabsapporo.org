More information about the [FabAcademy Cost Structure](https://fabacademy.org/apply/fees.html#title-tuition-fees-fab-academydescription-discover-the-details-of-fab-academy-tuition-fees-an-investment-in-your-educational-journey-learn-about-the-cost-structure-and-payment-options)

<em>Auditing & Lab Access</em> is more expensive than <em>Local Costs</em> because of the increased workload on the Local Instructors.

:::

## Pre-Fab

The course starts in January 2025, it will be an intensive journey - you will probably run out of time to finish the weekly assignments in the depth you want. We highly suggest that you take the time from now until the beginning of FabAcademy to learn about:

- Git
- SSGs, Static Site Generators
- Parametric Modelling in 3D (Fusion 360, FreeCAD)
- Programming MCUs (Arduino, ESP32, XIAO, etc)
- EDA (Eagle, KiCad)

While you will have access to a 3D Printer, we highly suggest to get your own, especially if you plan to make longer prints and larger objects.

## Interviews

We are happy to talk to you in-person or via Zoom about the benefits and challenges of FabAcademy. The reason why only ~50% of the students each year manage to finish the course and graduate is not the difficulty of the topics, but an underestimating of the time required to finish the course.

With the personal interview we want to make sure that you know exactly what you have to do for FabAcademy.

## Any Questions
